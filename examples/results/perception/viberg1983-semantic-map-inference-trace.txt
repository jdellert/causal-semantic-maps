Reading isolectic sets from input file: /home/jdellert/synchro/arb/lty/smp-frontiers/experiments/clics3-full.tsv
Will write semantic map in DOT format to output files with prefix /home/jdellert/synchro/arb/lty/smp-frontiers/experiments/perception/viberg1983
DOT files will include coordinates specified in file /home/jdellert/synchro/arb/lty/smp-frontiers/experiments/perception/viberg1983-clics-concept-coordinates.tsv
Will apply arrow inference in order to derive a diachronic semantic map.
Analysis is limited to concepts specified in file: /home/jdellert/synchro/arb/lty/smp-frontiers/experiments/perception/viberg1983-clics-concepts.txt
Will discard data from languages with more than 2 relevant concepts missing.
